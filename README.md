The Challenge & Solution (Highlighting Technical Skill)

The core challenge was integrating promotional flags with daily sales data:SQL & Data Modeling: 

Used a complex Common Table Expression (CTE) structure to join three tables (promos, products, and sales_daily) to accurately attribute a promo_flag to every sales transaction. This was critical for maintaining a clean, performant data model.

DAX: Developed calculated measures (like Total Promoted Sales) using the CALCULATE function to isolate and quantify the exact financial impact of promotions ($R 11.26$M in this view).
